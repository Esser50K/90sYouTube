## Hosting

I'm hosting this for everyone for free.
But of course there are server costs (and I don't even care much about "development costs"), But I would totally appreciate a small donation to cover the server costs so I can keep running this for free for everyone C:

<form action="https://www.paypal.com/donate" method="post" target="_top"><input type="hidden" name="hosted_button_id" value="LA3SGLKW7N4U8" /><input type="image" src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donate_LG.gif" border="0" name="submit" title="PayPal - The safer, easier way to pay online!" alt="Donate with PayPal button" /><img alt="" border="0" src="https://www.paypal.com/en_PT/i/scr/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1" /></form>
